      <blockquote>
	I am currently writing the guts of the server.
	I thought about writing it all in lisp but then I realized that I would
	go insane if id did. The current server software is written in Python with
	a module in C that does the heavy lifting like encoding/decoding/mixing the audio.
	The server will accept audio data via HTTP POST. You will need an account to join
	which will be added manually to protet against DoS attacks. The site will have a
	java applet on the logged in section which will access your local microphone and 
	encode locally. When the site is done I <i>will</i> release the source for
	everything. If you'd like to help out with the development talk to
