This is a specification for the anonstream codec wrapper.

What the FUCK does it do?

The anonstream codec on a high level will take multiple streams of speex compressed
audio and *magically* turn it into a single ogg vorbis audio stream.
It will be thread safe too :3

currently the plan is to use libfishsound and the python FFI for C
